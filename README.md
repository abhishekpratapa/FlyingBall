<h1>Things to do</h1>
<br/>
<h3>Computer work</h3><br/>
[x] Render still images<br/>
[] Run airfoil simulation <br/>
[] Render marketing preview<br/>
[] Render airfoil stream charts<br/>
[] Run electrical simulations (battery)<br/>
[] Document Lift, Drag characteristics at different RPM's<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Research</h3><br/>
[] Research proper airfoils for low Reynold's numbers<br/>
[] Identify the best way to simulate flying device physics in python opengl<br/>
[] Mark all the necessary components for an MVP<br/>
<h3>Setup work</h3><br/>
[] Set up the ball animation for the marketing video<br/>
[] Set up the airfoils for the simulation
<br/>
<h3>Design work</h3><br/>
[] Design a PCB for the device<br/>
[] Design a variety of airfoil designs based on parsed data<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Programming</h3><br/>
[] Parse airfoil data to find the best airfoil's at certian Reynold's values<br/>
[] design a simulated version of the ball in OpenGL python<br/>
[] check simulated version in python against a physics engine<br/>
[] Program a controller for stabilizing the flight of the ball<br/>
[] Write a program to set up the airfoils and automatically run them once plugged in via USB<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Business Setup</h3><br/>
[] Identify target markets<br/>
[] Write a plan of beaching (How do we enter the market?)<br/>
[] business canvas<br/>
